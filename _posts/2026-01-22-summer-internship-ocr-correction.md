Patrick Liu describes his summer internship at the ISAW Library working on the Post-OCR Correction Using Latin Annotations (POCULA) project.

The POCULA initiative aims to create clean, annotated Latin textual datasets for training language models that can correct errors introduced during optical character recognition of digitized texts.

Patrick's primary responsibility involved comparing scanned documents with their corresponding raw OCR outputs, identifying errors line-by-line and annotating corrections. He discovered consistent patterns in OCR mistakes, particularly the confusion between the long S and standard "f," ampersands replacing "et," and "v" substituted for "u."

Working with selections from Conrad Gessner's *Historia Animalium*, a Renaissance zoological encyclopedia, proved especially rewarding. Patrick found himself reading about various creatures while appreciating the text's "interconnectedness of scholarship between the classical and Renaissance worlds." The work highlighted how "letters and words were so easily bent or altered," demonstrating the fragility of digital text conversion.

The experience provided valuable technical skills while contributing to "the important digital future of Latin."
