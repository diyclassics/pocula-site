*Post-OCR Corrections Using Latin Annotations* (POCULA) is a text data correction project led by [Patrick J. Burns](https://isaw.nyu.edu/people/staff/patrick-burns) at NYU's [Institute for the Study of the Ancient World Library](https://isaw.nyu.edu/library). The project addresses corruption in digitized Latin texts from large repositories like Common Corpus by developing machine learning models to correct optical character recognition (OCR) errors.

## Goals

POCULA aims to:

- Compile 10,000 Latin sentence pairs from Common Corpus texts
- Match digitized documents to original scans where possible
- Train interim correction models at 1,000, 2,500, and 5,000 sentence milestones
- Enable correction of corrupted Latin text at scale to improve language model training

By correcting even 1% of Common Corpus's 34 billion tokens, POCULA could yield approximately 340 million tokens—among the largest available digitized Latin collections—providing a foundation for improved Latin language models.
